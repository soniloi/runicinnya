This is an imaginary city generator, also suitable for a very specific sort of dungeon layout.

It envisions cities without roads, where the basic organizational element is a courtyard. Buildings and connecting walkways fit around courtyards in a highly prescriptive pattern.

Various input parameters will control what sort of buildings, courtyards, etc. make up the city. Output will be in SVG format, showing the generated city's plan.

Still very much a work in progress :-)
